# AI-based Project for Cybersecurity (AI4Cyber)

## Project Description

This project involves developing a comprehensive machine-learning solution that integrates project management, design elements, and technical implementation to address real-world cybersecurity challenges.

The project consists of three phases: 
1. Creating a detailed project management plan.
2. Implementing a machine learning model.
3. Developing a dynamic website to showcase their results.

The Machine Learning Web Application aims to deliver an interactive platform for users to engage with machine learning models and visualize data insights. The primary goal is to demonstrate practical machine learning applications in real-world cybersecurity-related scenarios, enhancing user interaction and understanding of the underlying models.

## Basic Provided Spam Email Dataset
This dataset contains emails labeled as either **ham (legitimate)** or **spam (junk email)**.

- **Columns**
  - `text`: The content of the email
  - `spam`: Label (0 = ham, 1 = spam) 

## Labels
- **0 → Ham**: Normal, non-spam emails
- **1 → Spam**: Junk or unwanted emails

## Feature Extraction Ideas
Students may extract features such as:
- Email length (characters, words)
- Frequency of special characters (`!`, `$`, etc.)
- Presence of keywords (e.g., *free, win, offer*)
- Word frequency or TF-IDF values

## Visualization Ideas
- Distribution of email lengths (spam vs. ham)
- Word clouds for spam and ham
- Histogram of keyword frequencies
